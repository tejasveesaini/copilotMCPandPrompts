This repository contains prompt template, showing the best practices to create effective prompts for GitHub Copilot MCP agents. The prompts are present in the `.github/prompts/` directory, and example outputs generated by these prompts are available in the `resources/output/` directory.

Important notes 
Next steps:
1. Make the prompts part of shared repository.
Add your central prompt repo as a Git Submodule inside the .github directory of your main projects. This keeps the templates in a single central repo, but "projects" them into every other repo. When you update the central repo, you just update the submodule reference.

### Working examples (same model will get similar output once we have fixed the template):
For better readability of md outputs file look at preview, not code. The test cases are in tabular format.
Refer folder [resources/output](resources/output) for outputs generated by these prompts.

### Core Principles for Effective Prompting
1. Clarity and Specificity: Use direct, simple language. Avoid vague queries; define exactly what you need.
2. Context : Provide background information, such as the intended audience or the purpose of the task.
3. Assign a Role (Persona): Instruct the model to act as a specific expert (e.g., "Act as a senior software engineer").
4. Define Constraints: Specify length, tone, style, and what to avoid (e.g., "Keep it under 200 words," "Use a professional tone").
5. Structure the Input: Use delimiters (like """ or ###) to clearly separate instructions from the data to be processed. 
#### Advanced Techniques
1. Few-Shot Prompting: Provide one or more examples of input and desired output to guide the model.
2. Chain-of-Thought (CoT): Ask the model to "think step-by-step" or explain its reasoning to improve accuracy on complex tasks.
3. Iterative Refinement: Treat prompting as a process. Test, evaluate the output, and refine the prompt.
4. Break Down Complex Tasks: Instead of one massive prompt, divide the task into smaller, sequential steps.
5. Let the AI Ask Questions: Instruct the model to ask clarifying questions until it has enough information to fulfill the request.
